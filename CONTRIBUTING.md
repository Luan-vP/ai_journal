Commit messages should follow conventional commits, and be prefixed with one of the following:

  - build
  - chore
  - ci
  - docs
  - feat
  - fix
  - perf
  - refactor
  - revert
  - style
  - test

Branches, Issues and PRs are all similarly prefixed.

e.g an issue - `feat: implement-colbert-retrieval` will be solved in branch - `feat/implement-colbert-retrieval` and merged as part of PR -  `feat/implement-colbert-retrieval`
